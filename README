Abstract:
  An implementation of a neural net with  a basic numerical gradient calculator
  in order to test behavior of backpropagation.
  The neural net does not have Bias in each layer (this will hopefully be added
  in the next iterations of this project)

  Also added are a couple of test runs on known data sets "Iris" and "Breast
  Cancer Philadelphia".
